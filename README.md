Pleiades Supercomputer
Pleiades supercomputer at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility
Pleiades is a distributed-memory SGI/HPE ICE cluster connected with InfiniBand in a dual-plane hypercube technology. Originally deployed in 2008, Pleiades has been expanded many times and is one of the world's most powerful supercomputers.

The system contains the following types of Intel Xeon processors: E5-2680v4 (Broadwell), E5-2680v3 (Haswell), E5-2680v2 (Ivy Bridge), and E5-2670 (Sandy Bridge). Pleiades is named after the astronomical open star cluster of the same name.
